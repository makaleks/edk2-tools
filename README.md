# EDK2-Tools

This repository contains some of my tools for edk2-projects, that worth sharing.

- [compilation_database_patch](compilation_database_patch/) allows to generate
  `compile_commands.json` file, that can be used by completion engines
- [uefi_and_gdb](uefi_and_gdb/) allows to pring GDB command, that loads `.debug`
  file with debug symbols at a correct address, based on QEMU logs
