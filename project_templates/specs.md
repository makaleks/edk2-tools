The `edk2new.py` tool uses tags and tag blocks. The full list of supported
tags and tag blocks is printed then passing the `--help` argument to the tool.

Tags has the form of `<TagName[:OriginName]>`, there the content in `[...]` is
optional. `TagName` is generated by the tool, `OriginName` is used in
`.dsc`-file processing to extract path to origin `.inf`-files in template
project.

Tag blocks are placed as comment on a separate line and consist of an opening
tag, including a space-separated list of target types (application, library,
driver...), and a closing tag. The content for a tag block is included in
destination file only if one of the target types in the opening tag was
requested by user.

The template processing is based on the following assumptions:
- The project template (with all tags used) is consistent
- An `.inf`-file base directory name is unique enough
- File extension is assumed to be a separate path node
  (let's mark it as note #1)
- All tags, used in paths in `.dsc` fill each used path node completely
  (according to note #1)
- No files with a tag before file extension contain more than one file
  extention
- All files in template project are text files
The template processing steps are:
1. Tool opens `.dsc`  
2. For each target in `[Components]` section of `dsc`:  
2.1. If target satisfies the current tag-block (i.e. the corresponding target
    type was requested), a pair `{'src_path': '...', 'dest_path': '...'}` of
    `.inf`-files is created  
2.2. Else the basedir of the target's `.inf`-file is added to `excluded_dirs`
     list  
3. Generate `.dsc` and `.dec` files from the root of the template project,
   replacing their basenames with destination project name
4. For all other files, requrcively in template project directory tree:
4.1. Check if a file must be excluded:  
4.1.1. If the file path starts from `Include/`, check if it contains a basename
       of any path from `excluded_dirs`  
4.1.2. Else, check if this file path starts from any path from `excluded_dirs`  
4.2. Use the same destination filepath it is in template project if this path
     cannot be replaced:  
4.2.1. If the file path starts from `Include/`:  
4.2.1.1. Find the basedir of some `src_path` which is contained by the testing
         filepath, stop replacing if no such entry found (goto 4.3)  
4.2.1.2. Replace all the path nodes of the file, using the basedir of the
         found `src_path` as a key and the basedir of the corresponding
         `dest_path` as a value (according to note #1)  
4.2.2. Else if the file completely matchs some `src_path`, except the file
       extension, replace it with the corresponding `dest_path`, using the
       origin file extension  
4.3. Use destination file content as the source file content taking into
     account tags used in it
